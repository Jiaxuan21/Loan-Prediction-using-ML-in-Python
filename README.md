# Problem Statement
There is a company named Dream Housing Finance that deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. So company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer information. Hence the problem is to identify the customer segments, and find those are eligible for taking loan so that we can target these customers. Also the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers the more beneficial it would be for the Dream Housing Finance Company.
